# Operations Runbook

This runbook covers day-two operation of the private single-instance deployment. Initial deployment and enrollment instructions live in [Deployment](./DEPLOYMENT.md). The release smoke record lives in [`../test/e2e/render-smoke.md`](../test/e2e/render-smoke.md).

## Current release gate

`npm start` runs the composed lifecycle through `src/server.ts` and `src/runtime/production-bootstrap.ts`. Keep the release blocked until `/readyz` is `200`, an authorized live DM receives one reply, restart/replay checks are recorded, and the remaining Spectrum 12.7 outbound GUID limitation is accepted or removed. A healthy `/healthz` alone is insufficient.

## Routine checks

Run from a trusted operator environment:

```bash
curl --fail --silent "https://<service-host>/healthz"
curl --silent --show-error "https://<service-host>/readyz"
```

Expected composed-service states:

- `/healthz` is HTTP 200 whenever the Node process can serve diagnostics.
- `/readyz` is HTTP 200 only when every critical component is `ok`.
- `/readyz` is HTTP 503 during shutdown, missing owner setup, a Photon installation not validated for the current owner revision, missing/expired Codex auth, capability loss, database failure, migration/queue failure, invalid disk/workspace storage, or Spectrum disconnect.
- Supermemory may be `disabled` or `degraded` without blocking the operational pipeline.

The readiness response includes detailed component state, bounded error codes,
and remediation actions. The dashboard reports setup status, active device codes
and verification URLs, the assigned number, and masked owner state. Treat a raw
owner phone, provider credential, database credential, message, unrestricted
provider error, or private path in these responses as a security incident.

## Dashboard operations

Dashboard setup mutations require same-origin and fetch-metadata validation.

The owner card shows either the setup form or only the masked active phone. The saved personal phone is the only authorized iMessage sender; the separately assigned Photon number is the destination shown at completion. The phone is entered in the dashboard and is not a fresh-deployment environment value.

To replace the owner, open **Change phone number**. U.S. owners can enter a normal 10-digit number without `+1`; international owners select **Not in the U.S.?** and choose their country. Save the new value, then reconnect Photon for that owner revision and verify one message from the new owner plus rejection of the previous owner. The replacement transaction increments the owner revision, activates the new encrypted identity, revokes prior owner-phone identities, and invalidates the old Photon binding while leaving collaborator identities unchanged. Never place a phone in a URL, log, or support ticket.

## Deploy procedure

1. Record the outgoing application commit and current `/readyz` response.
2. Read new migration notes and confirm backward compatibility.
3. Confirm a database recovery point exists.
4. Verify the container configuration, persistent volume, and service secrets. Preserve the [existing deployment UUID](./DEPLOYMENT.md#preserve-an-existing-deployment-uuid), encryption key, and database.

5. Run the required local test suite and record skipped tests.
6. Deploy the reviewed commit. Confirm startup migrations succeed before the service accepts messages.
7. Require `/healthz` HTTP 200 and `/readyz` HTTP 200.
8. Send one authorized, non-mutating test message only after readiness passes.
9. Restart the service and repeat readiness plus one follow-up turn.

## Graceful restart

Configure the hosting environment to send `SIGTERM` and allow the application's bounded shutdown hooks to finish. The composed bootstrap marks readiness false and aborts active work before running stop hooks in this order:

1. Spectrum receive loop.
2. Active Codex work.
3. Outbound cursor checkpoint.
4. pg-boss workers.
5. PostgreSQL connections.
6. HTTP listener.

After restart, require reconciliation of undrained inbound messages, queued planning chains, missing approval request/action jobs, resumable outbound batches, and unpublished memory curation candidates before readiness returns to 200. Queue workers are created once per process; only Spectrum intake is restarted by activation recovery. Verify no stale chain sends, no action executes twice, and no outbound cursor moves backward.

## Incident playbooks

### Codex auth missing or expired

Symptoms: `/healthz` 200; `/readyz` 503; the dashboard reports Codex authentication needs attention; Spectrum startup remains paused.

ChatGPT mode:

```bash
npm run codex:login
npm run codex:status
```

Complete device login, verify `$CODEX_HOME/auth.json` remains mode `0600`, then refresh model settings. One refresh must produce one catalog persistence and only the required effective-pair probe. Capability recovery should start exactly one Spectrum run.

API-key mode: replace `OPENAI_API_KEY` in the service configuration, restart, and rerun capability probes. Do not change `CODEX_AUTH_MODE` as a fallback unless that is an explicit operator decision.

### Owner identity missing or legacy migration required

Symptoms: `/healthz` 200; `/readyz` 503; Spectrum intake remains stopped; the dashboard asks for an owner phone.

For a fresh deployment, save the personal owner phone in the dashboard and continue to Photon. U.S. entry defaults to national format; international entry requires a selected country, and the server normalizes both to E.164. For an existing deployment, first verify whether `OWNER_PHONE_NUMBER`, the former long Render alias, or `AGENT_OWNER_HANDLES` is present. The runtime imports only one unambiguous E.164 value and never imports owner identity from Photon credentials. A legacy Photon credential file may be imported into the durable installation record, but Spectrum remains blocked until the provider validates it for the current owner revision. If multiple handles or an email-only handle caused migration-required state, open the dashboard and save the intended phone explicitly. Verify the masked status, current-revision Photon connection, and an authorized message before manually removing old environment values.

### Photon installation incomplete or stale

Symptoms: `/healthz` 200; `/readyz` 503; the dashboard reports Photon setup required, reconnecting, or an owner-revision mismatch; Spectrum intake is stopped.

1. Confirm the current masked owner is correct before starting setup.
2. Resume the dashboard device flow; do not create a second installation while an operation is active.
3. Wait for provider validation and owner registration to commit to PostgreSQL.
4. Confirm the connected installation revision equals the current owner revision.
5. Verify activation starts exactly one Spectrum run. If the owner changes again, repeat setup for the new revision.

### Spectrum disconnect

Symptoms: `/readyz` 503; the dashboard or private logs report `SPECTRUM_STREAM_DISCONNECTED` or `SPECTRUM_STREAM_RESTART_EXHAUSTED`.

1. Check Photon provider status and the Web Service's Spectrum credentials without printing them.
2. Allow the bounded supervised reconnect policy to run.
3. If exhausted, the activation coordinator clears active ownership and schedules bounded recovery. Restart only after recovery remains exhausted or operator intervention is required.
4. Verify reconciliation and route rehydration from persisted space GUID/route phone.
5. Confirm one authorized DM and check for duplicate outbound parts.

### PostgreSQL timeout/outage

Symptoms: `/healthz` 200; `/readyz` 503; readiness or private logs report `DATABASE_UNAVAILABLE`; downstream startup stages do not run.

1. Stop manual message execution.
2. Check PostgreSQL health and the configured `DATABASE_URL` secret.
3. Restore connectivity and verify migrations.
4. Restart the service.
5. Run reconciliation and inspect safe failure counts/correlation IDs.
6. Confirm queued work resumes exactly once.

### Supermemory timeout/outage

Symptoms: the dashboard or private logs report memory recall unavailable/degraded; core readiness can remain healthy.

This is the required operating policy. Automated integration coverage verifies that each application retry uses a fresh abort signal and chaos coverage verifies durable candidate recovery after queue publication failure. A protected live-provider outage exercise is still separate release evidence.

1. Do not stop operational messaging solely for memory unavailability.
2. Verify planning used an empty memory context rather than stale cross-owner data.
3. Leave projection jobs retryable; inspect redacted receipt/failure codes.
4. After recovery, verify a bounded recall and one temporary add/search/delete smoke item in a test owner container.
5. Never replay raw messages into Supermemory.

### Approval or action job missing

Symptoms: a task remains `needs_approval`, an approved action remains pending, or no request/execution job is visible after a queue outage.

1. Do not create a replacement approval or manually edit the encrypted payload.
2. Restore PostgreSQL and pg-boss, then restart or invoke normal reconciliation.
3. Verify one `approval.request` job exists for each unresolved task and one `approval.execute` job exists for each pending action execution.
4. Confirm the responder is the owner in the allowed space; collaborator approvals must remain rejected.
5. Verify the stored idempotency key and terminal action state before considering any manual provider-side recovery.

### Persistent disk missing or invalid

Symptoms: `/readyz` 503; readiness or private logs report `PERSISTENT_STORAGE_INVALID`.

1. Stop execution; do not create replacement Codex threads on ephemeral storage.
2. Verify the `/data` mount, ownership, space, and directory permissions.
3. If the disk is lost, revoke potentially exposed credentials, attach replacement storage, and re-enroll Codex.
4. Recreate workspaces from trusted remotes/backups.
5. Resume from bounded PostgreSQL summaries.

### Partial outbound batch

1. Do not reset the outbound cursor manually.
2. Restore Spectrum connectivity.
3. Let the resumable batch job claim the persisted `start_index`.
4. Confirm every retry uses the materialized part's original client GUID.
5. Compare database part states with visible provider results; preserve evidence of any provider-level duplicate.

## Rollback

Roll back application and schema independently.

1. Stop new execution and let graceful shutdown checkpoint state.
2. Select the last known-good application commit compatible with the **current** schema.
3. Roll back the application release to that commit.
4. Do not undo forward-compatible migrations merely to match code.
5. If schema rollback is mandatory, stop all workers, verify a backup/recovery point, and use only the SQL in the migration's `.notes.md`.
6. Restart, reconcile, verify both health endpoints, and run a non-mutating authorized turn.

If compatibility is uncertain, roll forward with a fix or restore the application and database together to a matched recovery point. The initial migration rollback is destructive and must not be used on a live database without an explicit data-loss decision.

## Auth transfer and re-enrollment

When ownership changes or a credential may be exposed:

1. Stop the service.
2. Revoke the old ChatGPT session/API key and rotate Photon, Supermemory, encryption, and database credentials as applicable.
3. Remove only the compromised Codex auth file after confirming the exact persistent path; do not delete the disk or workspace tree.
4. Run the appropriate enrollment flow.
5. Verify credential file permissions, status, capability probes, restart persistence, and readiness.
6. Review failure/audit logs for unexpected use, without copying private payloads.

## Remove obsolete dashboard credential variables

Before upgrading an existing service:

1. Open the Web Service's private environment configuration.
2. Delete both former dashboard credential variables in the configuration for the next deployment.
3. Deploy this release. Startup intentionally rejects either obsolete key, even when it is empty.
4. Open the dashboard and verify owner, Photon, and ChatGPT state.

## Evidence and escalation

Record timestamps, commit, hosting release ID, readiness evidence, redacted diagnostic states, correlation IDs, tests run, and whether a live provider was actually exercised. Never paste raw messages, device codes, secrets, auth files, phone/email handles, or full provider exceptions into incident tickets.

Escalate and keep execution paused when:

- authorization or outbound routing cannot be proven;
- PostgreSQL state is unavailable or inconsistent;
- a stale/canceled chain sends;
- an outbound retry changes client GUID;
- credentials appear in logs or health responses;
- the old application/schema compatibility is unknown; or
- executable composition does not match the reviewed `src/server.ts` and `production-bootstrap.ts` release.
