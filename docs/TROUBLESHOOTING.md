# Troubleshooting

Start with the visible symptom. Run commands only in a trusted local terminal or the private service shell. Redact output before sharing it.

## Deploy failed during build

**What it means:** Dependencies did not install or TypeScript did not compile.

**Where to check:** Container build logs for the first failed command and the exact commit being built.

**Exact safe command:**

```bash
npm ci --include=dev && npm run build
```

**Expected result:** Both commands exit 0 and `dist/server.js` exists.

**Do not:** Print environment variables, remove `package-lock.json`, or bypass the pinned toolchain to make the build green.

## Pre-deploy migration failed

**What it means:** The new service was not started because `npm run db:migrate` could not apply or verify the checked-in migrations.

**Where to check:** Migration/startup logs and the matching `src/db/migrations/*.notes.md` files.

**Exact safe command:**

```bash
npm run db:migrate
```

**Expected result:** The command exits 0 against the intended database.

**Do not:** Print `DATABASE_URL`, drop application or pg-boss tables, edit an already-applied migration, or improvise a down migration.

## `/healthz` returns an error

**What it means:** The HTTP process is not reachable or could not serve liveness.

**Where to check:** Hosting service status, start logs, port binding, and the deployed commit.

**Exact safe command:**

```bash
curl --fail --silent --show-error "https://<service-host>/healthz"
```

**Expected result:** HTTP 200 with `{"status":"ok"}`.

**Do not:** Expose the service environment or treat repeated blind restarts as a diagnosis.

## `/readyz` remains 503

**What it means:** One or more critical components are missing, starting, failed, or degraded.

**Where to check:** `/readyz` or the dashboard for bounded component/setup detail, then the corresponding private service logs.

**Exact safe command:**

```bash
curl --silent --show-error "https://<service-host>/readyz"
```

**Expected result:** HTTP 200 only when configuration, database, migrations, queue, owner identity, Codex, storage, and Spectrum are ready. HTTP 503 during incomplete setup includes the detailed component snapshot and bounded remediation actions. Before a fresh owner is saved, `/healthz` stays 200 while `/readyz` correctly stays 503.

**Do not:** Use `/healthz` as acceptance, paste raw provider errors into tickets, or weaken readiness checks.

## Obsolete dashboard credential variable blocks startup

**What it means:** An existing service still has one of the two removed dashboard credential variables. This release rejects either legacy key, including an empty value.

**Where to check:** The deployed Web Service's private environment configuration. Do not print or copy the values.

**Expected result:** Delete both former dashboard credential variables in the configuration for the next deployment, then deploy this release. The service starts and the dashboard opens directly.

**Do not:** Re-add either removed credential to `.env.example`, the environment schema, or deployment instructions.

## Setup action returns 403

**What it means:** The request has a missing or foreign `Origin`, or reports a cross-site `Sec-Fetch-Site` value.

**Where to check:** Confirm the dashboard was opened directly from the deployed service origin and refresh it before retrying.

**Expected result:** Same-origin dashboard requests include the correct browser `Origin` automatically, and cross-site requests remain unavailable.

**Do not:** Disable Origin/fetch-metadata validation.

## Owner setup is missing or migration is required

**What it means:** No active owner identity exists in PostgreSQL, or legacy `AGENT_OWNER_HANDLES` contains multiple handles or a non-phone identity that cannot be migrated to the single-phone flow safely.

**Where to check:** Open the dashboard. Check legacy owner environment keys only in the private service environment configuration; do not print their values or use stored Photon metadata as authorization evidence.

**Expected result:** Saving one valid dashboard phone creates a masked configured status, keeps the raw phone out of responses and logs, unlocks Photon setup, and survives restart. U.S. national entry and country-selected international entry are normalized to E.164 before storage. An already active database identity takes precedence over every legacy environment value.

**Do not:** Select one legacy handle silently, copy the owner from Photon credential metadata, add a fallback route, or delete old environment values before verifying the migrated identity.

## Previous owner can still message after replacement

**What it means:** The owner replacement invariant or deployed revision is incorrect.

**Where to check:** Stop intake and inspect redacted `channel_identities` state through an authorized database procedure. Exactly one owner identity should be active for the deployment; older owner identities should have `revoked_at` set.

**Expected result:** The previous phone is rejected before persistence, queueing, or model work, while the replacement phone is accepted. Collaborator identities are unchanged.

**Do not:** Delete identity history, edit fingerprints manually, or resume intake while multiple active owner identities exist.

## Codex authentication is missing

**What it means:** ChatGPT device credentials are absent/expired, or API-key mode lacks a valid secret.

**Where to check:** The dashboard for Codex auth state and the private service shell.

**Exact safe command:**

```bash
npm run codex:status
```

For ChatGPT mode, enroll with `npm run codex:login`, then rerun the status command.

**Expected result:** Codex reports an authenticated session without printing credentials.

**Do not:** Print, copy, or upload `$CODEX_HOME/auth.json`; do not switch auth modes as an unreviewed fallback.

## Codex capability probe failed

**What it means:** Authentication succeeded, but a configured model/effort/permission pair could not run.

**Where to check:** The dashboard for `CODEX_CAPABILITY_FAILED`, model variables, and redacted private startup logs.

**Exact safe command:**

```bash
npm run typecheck && npm test -- test/unit/capabilities.test.ts
```

**Expected result:** Configuration and offline routing/probe contracts pass. A protected live probe is still required to prove the account/model pair.

**Do not:** Silently downgrade the model or effort, enable reasoning fallback, or broaden sandbox/network permissions.

## Spectrum is disconnected

**What it means:** The persistent `app.messages` stream is not connected or exhausted its bounded restart policy.

**Where to check:** The dashboard or private logs for `SPECTRUM_STREAM_DISCONNECTED` or `SPECTRUM_STREAM_RESTART_EXHAUSTED`, plus Photon provider status.

**Exact safe command:**

```bash
npm test -- test/unit/transport/message-loop.test.ts test/unit/transport/spectrum.test.ts
```

**Expected result:** Offline reconnect and provider-narrowing contracts pass. After live credentials recover, `/readyz` returns 200.

**Do not:** Print the Spectrum secret or line address, enable webhook intake on a host that keeps the agent running (it is only for hosts that put the agent to sleep, see `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`), or create a second messaging SDK.

## Authorized number is rejected

**What it means:** The sender reported by Spectrum does not match an enabled application owner identity or group policy.

**Where to check:** `AGENT_OWNER_HANDLES` format, the sender identity reported through protected diagnostics, and authorization tests.

**Exact safe command:**

```bash
npm test -- test/security/authorization-boundaries.test.ts test/unit/transport/sender-identity.test.ts
```

**Expected result:** E.164/email normalization and both authorization gates pass.

**Do not:** Log or paste the raw handle, authorize every sender, or bypass the second authorization check before process start.

## Agent receives messages but does not reply

**What it means:** Inbound persistence succeeded, but planning, execution, synthesis, or outbound delivery is pending, failed, canceled, or rate-limited.

**Where to check:** The dashboard, safe correlation IDs in private logs, queue/failure counts, and the release smoke record.

**Exact safe command:**

```bash
npm test -- test/chaos/durable-stage-recovery.test.ts test/chaos/outbound-restart.test.ts
```

**Expected result:** Durable reconciliation and outbound cursor invariants pass offline. A live message still requires protected provider evidence.

**Do not:** Manually advance outbound cursors, replay raw queue payloads, delete durable rows, or run Codex inline to bypass the queue.

## Database is unavailable

**What it means:** PostgreSQL could not connect or respond; readiness closes to prevent untracked work.

**Where to check:** PostgreSQL status, the configured `DATABASE_URL` secret, and redacted `DATABASE_UNAVAILABLE` logs.

**Exact safe command:**

```bash
npm test -- test/chaos/database-timeout.test.ts
```

**Expected result:** Liveness stays available, readiness becomes 503, and downstream startup does not proceed while the database is unavailable.

**Do not:** Print the database URL, start manual Codex work, truncate tables, or replace PostgreSQL with Supermemory.

## Persistent disk is unavailable

**What it means:** `CODEX_HOME` or the workspace root is missing, overlapping, incorrectly permissioned, or not backed by the intended disk.

**Where to check:** Persistent volume attachment and private shell path metadata.

**Exact safe command:**

```bash
test -d "$CODEX_HOME" && test -d "$AGENT_WORKSPACE_ROOT" && npm test -- test/unit/persistent-storage.test.ts
```

**Expected result:** Both directories exist as separate private paths and storage policy tests pass.

**Do not:** Print directory contents, create credentials on ephemeral storage, recursively change broad filesystem permissions, or delete the disk/workspace tree.

## Supermemory is disabled or degraded

**What it means:** The optional API key is absent, or bounded recall/write operations are unavailable. Operational PostgreSQL state is unaffected.

**Where to check:** The dashboard for `supermemory: disabled|degraded` and redacted memory receipt/failure codes in private logs.

**Exact safe command:**

```bash
npm test -- test/unit/supermemory-client.test.ts test/integration/memory-isolation.test.ts
```

**Expected result:** Disabled mode remains explicit; offline timeout/isolation contracts pass. Live add/search/delete evidence remains separate.

**Do not:** Upload raw messages, use another owner's container, or move queue, authorization, approval, or delivery state into memory.

## Duplicate or partially sent response

**What it means:** An outbound batch stopped between provider acknowledgement and cursor checkpoint, or provider-visible deduplication did not occur.

**Where to check:** Materialized outbound part state, persisted cursor, safe batch/correlation IDs, and provider-visible results.

**Exact safe command:**

```bash
npm test -- test/chaos/outbound-restart.test.ts
```

**Expected result:** Offline retries preserve the same logical client GUID and the cursor only advances after acknowledgement.

**Do not:** Reset the cursor, delete the batch, resend manually, or claim exactly-once delivery. The pinned Spectrum API does not currently accept the application's stable GUID, so a post-acknowledgement crash can duplicate one bubble.

## Still blocked

Record the exact commit, timestamp, readiness evidence, redacted diagnostic state, safe correlation IDs, commands run, and whether any live provider was exercised. Use [Operations](./OPERATIONS.md) for recovery and escalation rules. Never include device codes, secrets, owner handles, raw messages, database URLs, private paths, auth files, or full provider exceptions.
